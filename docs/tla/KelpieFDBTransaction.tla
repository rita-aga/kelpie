(*
 * TLA+ Specification for FoundationDB Transaction Semantics in Kelpie
 *
 * This spec models the transaction guarantees that Kelpie relies on from FDB:
 * - Serializable isolation (concurrent transactions appear to execute serially)
 * - Conflict detection (conflicting read-write or write-write detected)
 * - Atomic commit (all-or-nothing)
 * - Read-your-writes (transaction sees its own uncommitted writes)
 *
 * References:
 * - ADR-002: FoundationDB Integration (G2.4 - conflict detection)
 * - ADR-004: Linearizability Guarantees (G4.1 - atomic operations)
 * - FDB Paper: https://www.foundationdb.org/files/fdb-paper.pdf

(* Safety invariants *)

\* Invariant 1: Serializable Isolation
\* All committed transactions can be arranged in a serial order such that
\* each transaction sees only the effects of transactions that precede it.
\*
\* We verify this by checking that the commit order respects read dependencies:
\* If transaction A reads a value written by B, then B must appear before A
\* in the commit order.
SerializableIsolation ==
    \A i, j \in 1..Len(commitOrder) :
        i < j =>
            LET tA == commitOrder[i]
                tB == commitOrder[j]
            IN \* tA committed before tB
               \* If tB read any key that tA wrote, that's a conflict that
               \* should have been detected (tB should have seen tA's writes
               \* or been aborted)
               \A k \in readSet[tB] :
                   writeBuffer[tA][k] # NoValue =>
                       \* Either tB saw tA's write (in its snapshot) or
                       \* tB wrote to k itself (overwriting tA)
                       \/ readSnapshot[tB][k] = writeBuffer[tA][k]
                       \/ writeBuffer[tB][k] # NoValue

\* Invariant 2: Conflict Detection
\* In FDB, conflicts are detected when:
\* - Transaction T1 reads key K from its snapshot
\* - Transaction T2 writes key K with a DIFFERENT value
\* - T2 commits BEFORE T1 tries to commit
\* - At T1's commit time, kvStore[K] != T1's snapshot[K] → T1 aborts
\*
\* The invariant: if both T1 (reader) and T2 (writer) committed, and T2
\* committed first with a different value, then either:
\* 1. T1's snapshot already reflected T2's write (different snapshots), OR
\* 2. T1 also wrote to K (overwriting T2's value), OR
\* 3. T1 committed before T2 (no conflict at T1's commit time), OR
\* 4. T2 wrote the same value as the snapshot (no visible change)
ConflictDetection ==
    \A tWriter, tReader \in Transactions :
        (tWriter # tReader /\
         txnState[tWriter] = COMMITTED /\ txnState[tReader] = COMMITTED) =>
            \A k \in Keys :
                \* If tWriter wrote k and tReader read k...
                (writeBuffer[tWriter][k] # NoValue /\ k \in readSet[tReader]) =>
                    \* ...either they had different snapshots, OR tReader also wrote k,
                    \* OR tReader committed first, OR tWriter wrote the same value
                    \/ readSnapshot[tWriter] # readSnapshot[tReader]
                    \/ writeBuffer[tReader][k] # NoValue
                    \/ writeBuffer[tWriter][k] = readSnapshot[tReader][k]  \* No change
                    \/ \E i, j \in 1..Len(commitOrder) :
                        /\ commitOrder[i] = tReader
                        /\ commitOrder[j] = tWriter
                        /\ i < j  \* tReader committed before tWriter

\* Invariant 3: Atomic Commit
\* A transaction's writes are either all visible or none are visible.
AtomicCommit ==
    \A t \in Transactions :
        txnState[t] = COMMITTED =>
            \* All writes from t are in kvStore
            \A k \in Keys :
                writeBuffer[t][k] # NoValue =>
                    \* Either our write is there, or someone wrote after us
                    \/ kvStore[k] = writeBuffer[t][k]
                    \/ \E t2 \in Transactions :
                        /\ t2 # t
                        /\ txnState[t2] = COMMITTED
                        /\ writeBuffer[t2][k] # NoValue

\* Invariant 4: Read Your Writes
\* A transaction always sees its own uncommitted writes.
\* (This is enforced by TxnRead, verified by construction)
ReadYourWrites ==
    \A t \in Transactions :
        txnState[t] = RUNNING =>
            \A k \in Keys :
                writeBuffer[t][k] # NoValue =>
                    TxnRead(t, k) = writeBuffer[t][k]

\* Invariant 5: Snapshot Reads
\* Reads within a transaction see a consistent snapshot from transaction start.
\* All reads reflect the state at Begin time (stored in readSnapshot),
\* not affected by concurrent commits from other transactions.
SnapshotReads ==
    \A t \in Transactions :
        txnState[t] = RUNNING =>
            \* The snapshot was taken at Begin and doesn't change during the transaction
            \* (readSnapshot is immutable after Begin - verified by checking it's set)
            \A k \in Keys :
                readSnapshot[t][k] # NoValue =>
                    \* If we haven't written to k, reads return the snapshot value
                    (writeBuffer[t][k] = NoValue => TxnRead(t, k) = readSnapshot[t][k])

\* Combined safety invariant
Safety ==
    /\ TypeOK
    /\ SerializableIsolation
    /\ ConflictDetection
    /\ AtomicCommit
    /\ ReadYourWrites
    /\ SnapshotReads

(* Liveness properties *)

\* Every started transaction eventually commits or aborts
EventualTermination ==
    \A t \in Transactions :
        txnState[t] = RUNNING ~> (txnState[t] = COMMITTED \/ txnState[t] = ABORTED)

\* A transaction with no conflicts eventually commits
\* (non-conflicting transactions make progress)
EventualCommit ==
    \A t \in Transactions :
        (txnState[t] = RUNNING /\ ~HasConflict(t)) ~> txnState[t] = COMMITTED

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(* State constraints for bounded model checking *)

\* Limit the number of committed transactions to keep state space tractable
