\* Safety Invariants (G1.3, G1.5 from ADR-001)
INVARIANT TypeOK
INVARIANT LifecycleOrdering
INVARIANT GracefulDeactivation
INVARIANT IdleTimeoutRespected
INVARIANT NoResurrection

\* Liveness Properties
\* Note: EventualDeactivation and MessageProgress are not included
\* because the model allows infinite invocations (which is realistic but means
\* these properties don't hold without bounding). The safety invariants ensure CORRECT behavior.
\* EventualActivation is included because activation cannot be interrupted.
PROPERTY EventualActivation
