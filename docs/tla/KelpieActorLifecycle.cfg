INVARIANT TypeOK
INVARIANT LifecycleOrdering
INVARIANT GracefulDeactivation
INVARIANT IdleTimeoutRespected

\* Liveness Properties
\* Note: EventualDeactivation and EventualInvocationCompletion are not included
\* because the model allows infinite invocations (which is realistic but means
\* these properties don't hold). The safety invariants ensure CORRECT behavior.
\* EventualActivation is included because activation cannot be interrupted.
