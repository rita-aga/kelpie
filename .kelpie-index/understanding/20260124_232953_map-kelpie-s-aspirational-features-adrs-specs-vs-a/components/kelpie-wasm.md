## Summary

STUB - Only placeholder struct, no implementation

## Connections

- kelpie-core

## Details

Single file (lib.rs) with 413 bytes containing:
- Documentation comments describing intended wasmtime/waPC integration
- All modules commented out: // pub mod module; // pub mod runtime; // pub mod wapc;
- Single placeholder: pub struct WasmRuntime;

Comment says "Phase 4 implementation" - not started.

## Issues

### [HIGH] WASM actor runtime is a stub with no implementation

**Evidence:** lib.rs has only placeholder struct WasmRuntime and commented-out modules
