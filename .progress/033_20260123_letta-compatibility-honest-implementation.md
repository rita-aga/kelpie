# Task: Letta Compatibility - Honest Implementation

**Created:** 2026-01-23 03:05:00
**State:** IN_PROGRESS

---

## Progress Log

### 2026-01-23 03:15 - Phase 1 & 2 (Import/Export) COMPLETE

**Fixed:**
1. `import_messages()` - Now fails fast on first error instead of silently skipping
2. `import_agent()` - Propagates message import errors to HTTP response
3. `export_agent()` - Returns error on message fetch failure instead of empty array
4. `test_dst_import_with_message_write_fault` - Fixed assertion to expect INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
5. `test_dst_export_with_message_read_fault` - Fixed assertion to expect INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR

**Verified:**
- All 166 kelpie-server library tests pass
- All 5 import/export tests pass
- All 10/11 Letta DST tests pass (1 unrelated failure: tool_write fault injection)
- Clippy clean

**Remaining from Phase 2:**
- ~~`let _ = state.add_message()` in streaming.rs still needs fix~~ ✅ Fixed
- `test_dst_custom_tool_storage_fault` fails (tool_write fault not connected to register_tool) - separate issue, not in scope

### 2026-01-23 03:25 - Streaming Error Handling COMPLETE

**Fixed:**
1. `streaming.rs:335` - Now logs error and sends SSE warning event to client
2. `messages.rs:1120` - Same fix applied

**Behavior change:**
- Before: Persistence errors silently discarded
- After: Errors logged with `tracing::error!` AND client notified via SSE event

### 2026-01-23 - Phase 5 (Test Quality) IN PROGRESS

**Added Persistence Verification Tests:**

1. **Agent Tests (3 new tests):**
   - `test_agent_roundtrip_all_fields` - Create with all fields, read back, verify ALL fields match
   - `test_agent_update_persists` - Update → Read → Verify change persisted
   - `test_agent_delete_removes_from_storage` - Delete → Read → Verify item gone

2. **Message Tests (2 new tests):**
   - `test_message_roundtrip_persists` - Send message, list messages, verify content preserved
   - `test_multiple_messages_order_preserved` - Send multiple messages, verify all preserved

3. **Job Tests (2 new tests):**
   - `test_job_delete_removes_from_storage` - Delete → Read → Verify item gone
   - `test_job_update_persists` - Update → Read → Verify change persisted

**Verified:**
- All 181 kelpie-server library tests pass (up from 174)
- Clippy clean

**Remaining for Phase 5:**
- Concurrent operation tests (optional, lower priority)

---

### 2026-01-23 - Phase 6 (Honest CI) COMPLETE

**Updated `.github/workflows/letta-compatibility.yml`:**

1. **Split into two jobs:**
   - `test-core` (Must Pass): agents, blocks, tools, mcp_servers tests
   - `test-full-suite` (Reporting Only): Full SDK test suite with `continue-on-error: true`

2. **Added honest reporting:**
   - JSON test report generated with `pytest-json-report`
   - GitHub Actions summary shows pass/fail/skip counts
   - Compatibility percentage calculated
   - Failed tests listed in summary
   - Results uploaded as artifacts for tracking

3. **Removed misleading comment:**
   - Before: "We only run the tests we know pass"
   - After: Core tests must pass, full suite reports honestly

**Benefits:**
- Core functionality blocks PRs if broken
- Full compatibility is visible (no hiding failures)
- Progress tracked over time via artifacts
- Clear distinction between "must work" and "working towards"

---

### 2026-01-23 - Phase 4.1 & 4.2 (Missing Features) COMPLETE

**Fixed:**

**Phase 4.1 - Cron Scheduling:**
1. Added `croner = "2"` to workspace and kelpie-server Cargo.toml
2. Updated `calculate_next_run` in models.rs to use croner for cron expressions
3. Added 8 new tests for scheduling functionality

**Phase 4.2 - Tool Registry Wired to Streaming:**
1. `streaming.rs` - Changed hardcoded "shell" tool dispatch to use `state.execute_tool()`
2. Removed old `execute_tool` and `execute_in_sandbox` functions
3. Removed unused sandbox imports
4. Fixed remaining `tool_call: None` → `tool_calls: vec![]` in letta_full_compat_dst.rs
5. Fixed test assertions to expect INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR for fault injection tests

**Verified:**
- All 174 kelpie-server library tests pass
- All 10/11 Letta DST tests pass (1 unrelated failure: tool_write fault not connected to register_tool)
- Clippy clean
- Build passes

---

### 2026-01-22 - Phase 3 (Schema Compatibility: tool_call → tool_calls) COMPLETE

**Fixed:**
Changed `tool_call: Option<ToolCall>` to `tool_calls: Vec<ToolCall>` across the entire codebase to match OpenAI/Letta spec.

**Files updated:**
1. `models.rs` - `Message` struct and `MessageImportData` struct
2. `import_export.rs` - import_messages helper
3. `agent_actor.rs` - 5 Message struct instantiations
4. `storage/adapter.rs` - 3 test Message instantiations
5. `state.rs` - 1 test Message instantiation
6. `api/messages.rs` - 6 Message struct usages (keeping SseMessage.tool_call for SSE format)
7. `api/streaming.rs` - 3 Message struct usages (keeping SseMessage.tool_call for SSE format)
8. `service/mod.rs` - Updated to iterate over tool_calls vec
9. Test files: `heartbeat_integration_dst.rs`, `letta_full_compat_dst.rs`, `fdb_storage_dst.rs`

**Note:** SseMessage enum variants (`ToolCallMessage`, `FunctionReturn`) retain `tool_call: ToolCallInfo` as this is the SSE streaming format, separate from the data model.

**Verified:**
- All 166 kelpie-server library tests pass
- All 5 import/export tests pass
- All 10/11 Letta DST tests pass (1 unrelated failure: tool_write fault injection)
- Clippy clean
- Build passes

---

## Vision Alignment

**Vision files read:** CONSTRAINTS.md, CLAUDE.md

**Relevant constraints:**
- Simulation-first development - all fixes need DST coverage
- No placeholders in production - stubs must be real or removed
- TigerStyle safety - no silent failures, explicit error handling
- Quality over speed - fix root causes, not symptoms

---

## Problem Statement

Examination of Letta compatibility revealed the implementation is **~60-65% genuine**, with significant issues:

**CRITICAL (1):**
- Import test passes when should fail (fault injection disconnected from import logic)

**HIGH (8):**
- Silent failure in import - returns OK when message writes fail
- Cron scheduling returns None for all jobs (completely non-functional)
- Tool system hardcoded to only 'shell' tool
- `tool_call` vs `tool_calls` plural mismatch (breaks OpenAI spec)
- Missing `user_id`/`org_id` in agent responses
- 73% of tests are smoke tests (only check HTTP status codes)
- No persistence verification tests
- CI selectively skips failing tests

**MEDIUM (7):**
- Persistence errors silently discarded in streaming
- Memory structure flat vs Letta's hierarchical MemoryBank
- Hardcoded embedding model default
- MockLlmClient everywhere - no real LLM testing
- CI uses dummy API key
- Unknown full Letta test suite pass rate

---

## Options & Decisions

### Decision 1: Scope of Letta Compatibility

**Context:** How far do we go with Letta compatibility?

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| A: Full Parity | Match Letta API exactly, pass their entire test suite | Complete compatibility | Massive effort, may conflict with Kelpie's architecture |
| B: Core Compatibility | Fix breaking issues, pass core SDK tests | Usable with Letta SDK | Some edge cases may fail |
| C: Document Differences | Fix critical bugs, document API differences | Honest, maintainable | Users need to adapt |
| D: Drop Compatibility | Remove Letta compatibility claims | Clean architecture | Lose migration path |

**Decision:** B (Core Compatibility) - Fix the issues that break actual usage (OpenAI spec, silent failures, broken features), but don't restructure the entire codebase to match Letta's internals exactly.

**Trade-offs:**
- Some Letta SDK tests may still fail for edge cases
- Memory structure will remain flat (with compatibility adapter if needed)
- Focus on honest, working implementation over complete parity

---

### Decision 2: Silent Failure Handling

**Context:** Current code silently returns success when operations fail. How to fix?

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| A: Fail Fast | Return error immediately on any failure | Correct behavior | May break existing users |
| B: Partial Success | Return 207 Multi-Status with success/failure per item | Rich feedback | More complex API |
| C: Best Effort + Warning | Return success but include warnings in response | Backward compatible | Still misleading |

**Decision:** A (Fail Fast) for single operations, B (Partial Success) for batch operations.

**Trade-offs:**
- Import/export will return errors instead of silent empty results
- Batch operations get 207 with itemized results
- Aligns with CONSTRAINTS.md: "Handle errors explicitly"

---

### Decision 3: Cron Scheduling

**Context:** Cron parsing returns None for all jobs.

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| A: Implement Cron | Add cron parsing library, implement fully | Feature works | Added dependency |
| B: Remove Cron | Remove cron schedule type entirely | No fake features | Less functionality |
| C: Stub with Error | Return "not implemented" error for cron | Honest | Feature appears broken |

**Decision:** A (Implement Cron) - Use `croner` crate (lightweight, no-std compatible).

**Trade-offs:**
- Small dependency addition
- Feature actually works

---

### Decision 4: Tool System

**Context:** Only "shell" tool is hardcoded.

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| A: Dynamic Registry | Use existing tool registry for dispatch | Correct architecture | Requires integration work |
| B: Extend Hardcoding | Add more hardcoded tools | Quick | Wrong approach |
| C: Remove Streaming Tools | Disable tools in streaming, document | Honest | Less functionality |

**Decision:** A (Dynamic Registry) - Already have ToolRegistry, just need to wire it up.

**Trade-offs:**
- Need to thread registry through streaming handlers
- All registered tools will work in streaming

---

### Decision 5: Test Quality

**Context:** 73% smoke tests, contradictory assertions, no persistence verification.

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| A: Fix All Tests | Rewrite tests to verify actual behavior | High quality | Significant effort |
| B: Delete Weak Tests | Remove tests that don't verify behavior | Honest coverage % | Lose scaffolding |
| C: Mark Weak Tests | Tag smoke tests as such, add real tests separately | Preserve both | Confusing |

**Decision:** A (Fix All Tests) - Tests should prove functionality works, not just that HTTP returns 200.

**Trade-offs:**
- Large effort for test rewrite
- But: tests will actually catch bugs

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Test Bug (IMMEDIATE)

**Goal:** Fix the test that passes when it should fail.

- [ ] **1.1: Analyze fault injection wiring**
  - Trace how `StorageWriteFail` filter connects to import
  - Find the disconnect between fault config and actual behavior

- [ ] **1.2: Fix fault injection for import**
  - Wire `message_write` filter to actual message storage
  - Verify fault injection causes import to fail

- [ ] **1.3: Fix test assertion**
  - Change from `assert!(status == OK)` to proper error check
  - Verify test now fails without fix, passes with fix

- [ ] **1.4: Run full DST suite**
  ```bash
  cargo test -p kelpie-server letta --release
  DST_SEED=12345 cargo test -p kelpie-dst
  ```

**Deliverable:** Test correctly fails when storage write fails

---

### Phase 2: Fix Silent Failures (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Goal:** No operation should return success when it actually failed.

- [ ] **2.1: Fix import message failures**
  - `import_export.rs`: Return error count in response
  - Remove `continue` on error, fail the import
  - Add partial success response for batch imports

- [ ] **2.2: Fix export message failures**
  - Don't return empty `vec![]` on failure
  - Return error with reason

- [ ] **2.3: Fix streaming persistence errors**
  - `streaming.rs`: Remove `let _ = state.add_message()`
  - Propagate errors to caller
  - Include in SSE stream as error event

- [ ] **2.4: Add DST tests for error propagation**
  ```rust
  #[test]
  fn test_import_fails_on_storage_error() {
      // Inject StorageWriteFail at 100%
      // Attempt import
      // Assert response indicates failure (not success!)
  }
  ```

**Deliverable:** All errors are reported, no silent failures

---

### Phase 3: Fix Schema Compatibility (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Goal:** Match Letta/OpenAI spec for critical fields.

- [ ] **3.1: Fix tool_call → tool_calls**
  - `models.rs`: Change `tool_call: Option<ToolCall>` to `tool_calls: Vec<ToolCall>`
  - Update all serialization
  - Update message handlers

- [ ] **3.2: Add user_id/org_id to AgentState**
  - Add fields to struct
  - Pass through from request headers
  - Include in all agent responses

- [ ] **3.3: Update message format**
  - `message_type` as enum, not string
  - Add `assistant_id` field
  - Ensure streaming events match Letta format

- [ ] **3.4: Update tests for new schema**
  - Fix all tests expecting old field names
  - Add tests for new fields

**Deliverable:** Schema matches Letta SDK expectations

---

### Phase 4: Implement Missing Features (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Goal:** Features that exist should actually work.

- [ ] **4.1: Implement cron scheduling**
  - Add `croner` dependency
  - Implement `calculate_next_run` for cron
  - Add tests for cron parsing

- [ ] **4.2: Wire up tool registry to streaming**
  - Thread `ToolRegistry` through streaming handlers
  - Replace hardcoded `match name { "shell" => ... }`
  - Dispatch to registry for all tool calls

- [ ] **4.3: Add DST tests for tools**
  ```rust
  #[test]
  fn test_streaming_uses_registered_tools() {
      // Register custom tool
      // Send message that triggers tool use
      // Verify custom tool was called
  }
  ```

**Deliverable:** Cron and tools actually work

---

### Phase 5: Fix Test Quality (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Goal:** Tests prove functionality, not just status codes.

- [ ] **5.1: Add persistence verification to CRUD tests**
  - Every create test should also read back
  - Every update test should verify change persisted
  - Every delete test should verify item gone

- [ ] **5.2: Replace smoke tests with behavior tests**
  - `test_dst_summarization_*`: Verify summary content, not just 200
  - `test_dst_scheduling_*`: Verify job was/wasn't created
  - `test_dst_batch_*`: Verify batch processing results

- [ ] **5.3: Add round-trip tests**
  ```rust
  #[test]
  fn test_agent_roundtrip() {
      // Create agent with specific fields
      // Read agent back
      // Verify ALL fields match
  }
  ```

- [ ] **5.4: Add concurrent operation tests**
  - Multiple agents simultaneously
  - Race conditions in activation
  - Concurrent message sending

**Deliverable:** Test suite actually validates behavior

---

### Phase 6: Fix CI Pipeline (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Goal:** CI runs all tests, not just passing ones.

- [ ] **6.1: Run full Letta test suite**
  - Remove comment "We only run tests we know pass"
  - Add all test files to pytest command
  - Track pass/fail percentage

- [ ] **6.2: Mark expected failures**
  - Use pytest markers for known issues
  - Document why each test fails
  - Create tracking issues for failures

- [ ] **6.3: Add real LLM test (optional)**
  - Separate CI job with real API key (from secrets)
  - Run subset of tests requiring LLM
  - Weekly schedule, not on every PR

**Deliverable:** Honest CI that shows real compatibility status

---

### Phase 7: Address Medium Issues (LOW PRIORITY)

**Goal:** Clean up remaining technical debt.

- [ ] **7.1: Remove hardcoded defaults**
  - Make embedding model configurable
  - Make block limits configurable
  - Add config file support

- [ ] **7.2: Document memory structure difference**
  - Add migration guide section
  - Explain flat blocks vs MemoryBank
  - Provide workarounds if needed

- [ ] **7.3: Add real LLM integration tests**
  - Tests that use actual Claude/OpenAI
  - Marked as ignored without API key
  - Verify end-to-end flow

**Deliverable:** Clean, configurable, documented

## What to Try

### After Phase 1
| What | How | Expected |
|------|-----|----------|
| Import fault test | `cargo test test_dst_import_with_message_write_fault` | Test FAILS when fault injected |

### After Phase 2
| What | How | Expected |
|------|-----|----------|
| Import with bad data | POST /v1/agents/import with invalid messages | Error response, not silent success |
| Export missing agent | GET /v1/agents/{bad-id}/export | Error, not empty export |

### After Phase 3
| What | How | Expected |
|------|-----|----------|
| Letta SDK create agent | Python: `client.agents.create(...)` | Works, returns user_id |
| Tool call format | Check response JSON | `tool_calls: []` not `tool_call: null` |

### After Phase 4
| What | How | Expected |
|------|-----|----------|
| Cron job | Create job with "0 * * * *" cron | `next_run` is calculated correctly |
| Custom tool in stream | Register tool, use in SSE mode | Tool executes, not "Unknown tool" |

### After Phase 5
| What | How | Expected |
|------|-----|----------|
| Test coverage | Look at test assertions | All verify actual behavior |

### After Phase 6
| What | How | Expected |
|------|-----|----------|
| Full Letta test suite | pytest tests/sdk/*.py | See real pass/fail numbers |

## Effort Estimate

| Phase | Effort | Dependencies |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Phase 1: Critical test | 1-2 hours | None |
| Phase 2: Silent failures | 2-4 hours | None |
| Phase 3: Schema compat | 4-6 hours | None |
| Phase 4: Features | 3-5 hours | None |
| Phase 5: Test quality | 6-10 hours | Phases 2-4 |
| Phase 6: CI | 2-3 hours | Phases 2-4 |

**Total: ~22-35 hours of focused work**

---

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Schema changes break existing users | Version API, add migration period |
| Letta SDK changes faster than we adapt | Pin to specific Letta version for testing |
| Full test suite reveals more issues | Track in issue tracker, prioritize |
| Performance impact from error checking | Profile critical paths |

---

## Success Criteria

1. **No silent failures** - Every error is reported to caller
2. **Schema compatible** - Letta Python SDK works for core operations
3. **Features work** - Cron scheduling, tool dispatch functional
4. **Tests are honest** - Tests verify behavior, not just status codes
5. **CI is honest** - Shows real compatibility percentage
