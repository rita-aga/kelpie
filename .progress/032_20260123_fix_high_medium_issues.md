# Task: Fix High and Medium Priority Issues

**Created:** 2026-01-23 01:15:00
**State:** PLANNING

---

## Vision Alignment

**Vision files read:** CONSTRAINTS.md, CLAUDE.md

**Relevant constraints:**
- Simulation-first development - all fixes need DST coverage
- No placeholders in production - stubs must be real implementations or removed
- TigerStyle safety principles - assertions, explicit error handling

---

## Problem Statement

Two examinations found significant issues blocking Kelpie's distributed guarantees:

**HIGH Issues (6 real issues):**
1. Cluster join is stub - seed node loop does nothing
2. No consensus algorithm (no Raft/Paxos)
3. RPC message handler is stub
4. Migration execution planned but never runs
5. Single activation is local-only (no distributed enforcement)
6. FDB registry backend not implemented

**MEDIUM Issues (7 issues):**
1. max_pending_per_actor config unused
2. Range scans not transactional (phantom reads!)
3. Registry state lost on restart
4. No kelpie-cluster tests
5. PlacementStrategy defined but not implemented
6. No heartbeat network sending
7. FDB tests not in CI

**Cleanup:**
- Delete kelpie-agent crate (stub, agent impl lives in kelpie-server)

---

## Options & Decisions

### Decision 1: Distributed Coordination Strategy

**Context:** How do we implement distributed single-activation?

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| A: FDB Leases | Use FDB transactions for distributed locks/leases | Matches ADR-002, already have FDB | Requires FDB cluster, complex |
| B: Raft Consensus | Implement Raft in kelpie-cluster | Industry standard, well-understood | Massive effort, reinventing wheel |
| C: Delegate to FDB | Let FDB handle all coordination, no custom consensus | Simplest, FDB is battle-tested | Tight coupling to FDB |
| D: etcd/Consul | Use external coordination service | Proven solutions | Another dependency |

**Decision:** C (Delegate to FDB) - FDB provides serializable transactions which can implement leases. No need for custom Raft. This aligns with ADR-002 and ADR-004.

**Trade-offs:**
- Hard dependency on FDB for production distributed mode
- Single-node mode can still use MemoryRegistry for dev/test

---

### Decision 2: What to do with kelpie-cluster stubs

**Context:** kelpie-cluster has stub implementations. Fix or remove?

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| A: Keep RPC, remove Raft | Use FDB for coordination, keep RPC for migration/forwarding | Best of both worlds | Still need some cluster code |
| B: Remove all stubs | Delete non-functional code, keep only types | Clean codebase | Lose RPC scaffolding |
| C: Full FDB | All communication through FDB | Simplest | Slower for data transfer |

**Decision:** A (Keep RPC, remove Raft) - Use FDB for the hard coordination problem (single-activation, membership), but keep cluster RPC for:
- Actor migration (transfer state between nodes)
- Request forwarding (route request to owning node)

**Trade-offs:**
- Still need to implement RPC properly (but no Raft!)
- Two systems: FDB for coordination, RPC for data transfer
- Acceptable because: FDB handles the hard consensus problem, RPC is just point-to-point

---

### Decision 3: Phantom reads fix scope

**Context:** list_keys() has phantom read bug - not transactional.

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| A: Fix in SimStorage | Fix for DST, defer FDB | Quick, enables testing | Production still broken |
| B: Fix everywhere | Fix SimStorage, MemoryKV, and FdbKV | Complete fix | More work |
| C: Document limitation | Note that list_keys isn't transactional | Honest | Bug remains |

**Decision:** B (Fix everywhere) - Range scans should read from transaction buffer. This is a linearizability bug.

---

## Quick Decision Log

| Time | Decision | Rationale | Trade-off |
|------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 2026-01-23 | FDB for coordination | Already have FDB, battle-tested | FDB dependency |
| 2026-01-23 | Keep RPC, remove Raft | FDB for consensus, RPC for data transfer | Two systems to maintain |
| 2026-01-23 | Fix phantom reads everywhere | Linearizability matters | More work |
| 2026-01-23 | Replace Notify with watch for shutdown | Notify::notified() misses signals if called before polling; watch maintains state | Minor API change |
| 2026-01-23 | Add list_keys to ActorTransaction trait | Transaction semantics require read-your-writes for all operations | Trait change requires impl everywhere |
| 2026-01-23 | Use HashSet for key merging | Dedup automatically, O(1) insert/remove | Order not preserved (acceptable) |
| 2026-01-23 | Lease-based activation lock | FDB atomicity + lease expiry = distributed lock | Requires background renewal |
| 2026-01-23 | JSON serialization for FDB values | Simple, debuggable, matches existing code | Slightly larger than binary |
| 2026-01-23 | Local node cache in FdbRegistry | Reduce FDB reads for placement decisions | Cache invalidation complexity |
| 2026-01-23 | Use Runtime abstraction in LeaseRenewalTask | DST compatibility - no direct tokio::spawn calls | Slightly more verbose |
| 2026-01-23 | Optional registry in Dispatcher | Backward compatible - single-node mode still works without registry | Two code paths to maintain |
| 2026-01-23 | Return ActorNotFound for remote actors | Placeholder until Phase 6 (forwarding) - clear error message includes owner node | User sees error instead of forwarding |
| 2026-01-23 | Trait callbacks for RPC handler | ActorInvoker and MigrationReceiver traits allow loose coupling | Requires implementing traits in runtime |
| 2026-01-23 | RwLock for pending migrations | Allows concurrent reads during migration | Small overhead for synchronization |
| 2026-01-23 | Defer TCP integration tests | Handler logic tested via DST mocks; TCP tested in unit tests | Full e2e test deferred |
| 2026-01-23 | Wire handler to transport | TcpTransport/MemoryTransport now route incoming requests to handler | Handler must be set before start() |
| 2026-01-23 | RequestForwarder trait | Loose coupling between Dispatcher and transport | Requires implementing trait |
| 2026-01-23 | Check placement before claim | get_placement() read-only check before try_claim_actor() | Small race window (handled by claim error) |

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Cleanup (LOW EFFORT)

**Goal:** Remove dead code, clean up stubs, prepare for proper implementation.

- [x] **1.1: Delete kelpie-agent crate** ✅
  - Remove from workspace Cargo.toml
  - Remove crates/kelpie-agent directory
  - Update any imports (likely none)

- [x] **1.2: Clean up kelpie-cluster** ✅
  - Keep: types, config, error, RPC message types
  - Marked: join_cluster with TODO(Phase 3) for FDB membership
  - Marked: drain_actors with TODO(Phase 6) for migration
  - Marked: failure detection migration with TODO(Phase 6)
  - Marked: rpc handler with TODO(Phase 6)
  - Keep: RPC client/server scaffolding (needed for migration/forwarding)
  - Keep: migration types (will implement in Phase 6)

- [x] **1.3: Verify builds** ✅
  ```bash
  cargo build --workspace  # PASSED
  cargo clippy -p kelpie-cluster -- -D warnings  # PASSED, no warnings
  cargo test -p kelpie-core  # 27 passed
  cargo test -p kelpie-cluster  # ALL 25 TESTS PASS in 0.02s
  ```

- [x] **1.4: Fix cluster shutdown hang bug** ✅ (bonus fix discovered during cleanup)
  - Root cause: `tokio::sync::Notify::notified()` misses signals if `notify_waiters()` fires before tasks poll
  - Fix: Replaced `Notify` with `tokio::sync::watch<bool>` which maintains state
  - Result: Cluster tests that hung 60+ seconds now complete in 0.02s

**Deliverable:** Clean codebase with clear TODO markers

---

### Phase 2: Fix Linearizability Bug (MEDIUM EFFORT) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Fix phantom reads in range scans.

- [x] **2.1: Fix SimStorage list_keys** ✅
  - Added `list_keys(&self, prefix: &[u8])` to `ActorTransaction` trait (kelpie-storage/src/kv.rs)
  - Implemented in `SimTransaction` (kelpie-dst/src/storage.rs)
  - Reads from write buffer + underlying storage, merges results, respects deletes

- [x] **2.2: Fix MemoryKV list_keys** ✅
  - Implemented in `MemoryTransaction` (kelpie-storage/src/memory.rs)
  - Added 3 unit tests: `test_transaction_list_keys_sees_uncommitted_writes`,
    `test_transaction_list_keys_respects_deletes`, `test_transaction_list_keys_prefix_filtering`

- [x] **2.3: Fix FdbKV list_keys** ✅
  - Implemented in `FdbActorTransaction` (kelpie-storage/src/fdb.rs)
  - Uses underlying FdbKV.list_keys + write buffer merge
  - Integration tests already exist (ignored without FDB cluster)

- [x] **2.4: DST test for transactional scans** ✅
  - Added 3 tests to kelpie-dst/src/storage.rs:
    - `test_transaction_list_keys_sees_uncommitted_writes` - verifies read-your-writes
    - `test_transaction_list_keys_respects_deletes` - verifies buffered deletes excluded
    - `test_transaction_list_keys_with_prefix` - verifies prefix filtering works with buffer

**Deliverable:** Transactional range scans with read-your-writes semantics, no phantom reads

**Test counts:**
- kelpie-dst: 73 unit tests (3 new), 10+ integration tests all pass
- kelpie-storage: 12 unit tests (3 new), 8 FDB tests ignored

---

### Phase 3: FDB Registry Backend (HIGH EFFORT) - IN PROGRESS

**Goal:** Implement FdbRegistry for distributed single-activation.

- [x] **3.1: Design FDB key schema for registry** ✅
  ```
  /kelpie/registry/nodes/{node_id}           -> NodeInfo (JSON)
  /kelpie/registry/actors/{namespace}/{id}   -> ActorPlacement (JSON)
  /kelpie/registry/leases/{namespace}/{id}   -> Lease (JSON)
  ```

- [x] **3.2: Implement FdbRegistry struct** ✅
  - Created `crates/kelpie-registry/src/fdb.rs`
  - Implemented full Registry trait
  - Added FdbRegistryConfig for lease duration settings
  - Uses FDB transactions for atomic operations
  - Local node cache for read optimization

- [x] **3.3: Implement distributed activation lock** ✅
  - Lease struct with node_id, acquired_at_ms, expires_at_ms, version
  - `try_acquire_lease()` - atomically acquire or renew lease
  - `release_lease()` - release lease when deactivating
  - `get_lease()` - read current lease state
  - `try_claim_actor()` - checks lease expiry before claiming

- [x] **3.4: Implement lease renewal** ✅
  - `renew_leases(node_id)` - scans and renews all leases owned by a node
  - `renew_lease(actor_id, node_id)` - renews a single specific lease
  - `LeaseRenewalTask` - background task that periodically calls `renew_leases()`
  - Uses Runtime abstraction for DST compatibility (no direct tokio calls)
  - Graceful shutdown via watch channel

- [ ] **3.5: Add DST tests with SimFdbRegistry** (TODO)
  - Need SimFdbRegistry that simulates FDB behavior
  - Test concurrent activation attempts
  - Test lease expiry and takeover

- [x] **3.6: Integration tests** ✅
  - `test_fdb_registry_node_registration` - node CRUD
  - `test_fdb_registry_actor_claim` - actor claim with lease
  - Both marked as ignored without FDB cluster

**Tests:**
- 4 new unit tests (Lease::new, expiry, renewal, ownership)
- 2 FDB integration tests (ignored)
- 47 total registry tests pass

**Deliverable:** Distributed single-activation guarantee via FDB (core implementation complete)

---

### Phase 4: Integrate FdbRegistry with Runtime (MEDIUM EFFORT) - IN PROGRESS

**Goal:** Wire up distributed registry to actor runtime.

- [x] **4.1: Add Registry to RuntimeBuilder** ✅
  - Added `registry` and `node_id` fields to `RuntimeBuilder`
  - Added `with_registry(registry, node_id)` method
  - Updated `build()` to pass registry to `Runtime::new()`
  ```rust
  RuntimeBuilder::new()
      .with_registry(fdb_registry, node_id)
      .with_kv(fdb_kv)
      // ...
  ```

- [x] **4.2: Modify activation flow** ✅
  - Added `registry` and `node_id` fields to `Dispatcher`
  - Added `Dispatcher::with_registry()` constructor
  - `activate_actor()` now calls `registry.try_claim_actor()` before local activation
  - Returns error if actor is owned by another node (with TODO for Phase 6 forwarding)
  - `handle_deactivate()` releases actor from registry
  - `shutdown()` releases all actors from registry

- [~] **4.3: Add lease renewal to runtime** (Deferred)
  - LeaseRenewalTask is implemented in kelpie-registry (Phase 3.4)
  - **Decision**: Users manage LeaseRenewalTask externally when using FdbRegistry
  - This keeps the runtime simple and doesn't add FDB-specific code
  - MemoryRegistry doesn't need lease renewal

- [x] **4.4: Tests for distributed activation** ✅
  - `test_dispatcher_with_registry_single_node` - single node claims actor
  - `test_dispatcher_distributed_single_activation` - two nodes compete, only one wins
  - `test_dispatcher_deactivate_releases_from_registry` - deactivation releases from registry
  - `test_dispatcher_shutdown_releases_all_from_registry` - shutdown releases all actors

**Tests:**
- 27 runtime tests pass (4 new distributed activation tests)
- 43 registry tests pass

**Deliverable:** Runtime uses registry for distributed coordination

---

### Phase 5: Remaining Medium Issues (LOW-MEDIUM EFFORT)

- [x] **5.1: Enforce max_pending_per_actor** ✅
  - Added `pending_counts: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, Arc<AtomicUsize>>>>` to `DispatcherHandle`
  - Added `max_pending_per_actor: usize` to `DispatcherHandle`
  - Implemented `PendingGuard` for automatic decrement on drop
  - In `invoke()`: increment counter, check limit, reject if over, decrement via guard
  - Added 2 tests: `test_dispatcher_max_pending_per_actor`, `test_dispatcher_max_pending_concurrent`

- [x] **5.2: Add kelpie-cluster tests** ✅
  - Already has 25 tests covering config, error, migration, rpc, and cluster
  - Config: 5 tests (default, single_node, with_seeds, validation, durations)
  - Error: 2 tests (display, retriable)
  - Migration: 3 tests (state, info, fail)
  - RPC: 8 tests (message types, transports, request IDs)
  - Cluster: 4 tests (create, start_stop, list_nodes, try_claim)
  - No additional tests needed

- [x] **5.3: Implement placement strategies** ✅
  - LeastLoaded: Already worked
  - Random: Already implemented (uses `rand::random()`)
  - RoundRobin: Added `round_robin_index: AtomicUsize` to MemoryRegistry
  - Affinity: Already implemented (checks preferred node, falls back to least loaded)
  - Added 5 new tests: `test_select_node_round_robin`, `test_select_node_affinity`,
    `test_select_node_affinity_fallback`, `test_select_node_random`, `test_select_node_no_capacity`
  - 48 registry tests now pass

- [x] **5.4: Implement heartbeat sending** ✅
  - Already implemented in `Cluster::start_heartbeat_task()` via RpcTransport broadcast
  - `HeartbeatTracker` manages heartbeat state in registry
  - `Registry::receive_heartbeat()` processes incoming heartbeats
  - DST tests exist: `test_dst_heartbeat_tracking`, `test_dst_failure_detection`
  - 16 cluster DST tests pass (2 stress tests ignored)

- [x] **5.5: Registry persistence (via FDB)** ✅
  - Already solved by FdbRegistry (implemented in Phase 3)
  - MemoryRegistry remains for testing only

**Deliverable:** All medium issues resolved

---

### Phase 6: Cluster RPC for Migration/Forwarding (MEDIUM EFFORT) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Implement proper RPC for actor migration and request forwarding.

- [x] **6.1: Define RPC protocol** ✅
  - Already defined in `kelpie-cluster/src/rpc.rs` as `RpcMessage` enum
  - Includes: ActorInvoke, MigratePrepare, MigrateTransfer, MigrateComplete, Heartbeat, LeaveNotification

- [x] **6.2: Implement RPC transport** ✅
  - Already implemented in `kelpie-cluster/src/rpc.rs`
  - `MemoryTransport` for testing/DST
  - `TcpTransport` for production with length-prefixed messages
  - 8 RPC tests pass

- [x] **6.3: Implement request forwarding** ✅
  - Created `ClusterRpcHandler` in `kelpie-cluster/src/handler.rs`
  - Handles `ActorInvoke` messages via `ActorInvoker` trait callback
  - Returns `ActorInvokeResponse` with result
  - **Wired to transport**: TcpTransport and MemoryTransport now call handler for incoming requests
  - **Dispatcher forwarding**: Added `RequestForwarder` trait and `with_forwarder()` builder
  - Dispatcher checks placement and forwards to remote node if forwarder is configured

- [x] **6.4: Implement actor migration handling** ✅
  - `ClusterRpcHandler` handles full migration protocol:
    - `MigratePrepare` → checks can_accept via `MigrationReceiver` trait
    - `MigrateTransfer` → stores pending state via `receive_state()`
    - `MigrateComplete` → activates actor via `activate_migrated()`
  - Tracks pending migrations in `RwLock<HashMap<ActorId, PendingMigration>>`
  - 3 handler unit tests pass

- [x] **6.5: DST tests for migration** ✅
  - Added `DstMockInvoker` and `DstMockMigrationReceiver` for testing
  - 4 DST tests:
    - `test_dst_rpc_handler_invoke` - request forwarding
    - `test_dst_rpc_handler_migration_flow` - full migration sequence
    - `test_dst_rpc_handler_migration_rejected` - rejected migration
    - `test_dst_rpc_handler_determinism` - reproducibility with same seed
  - 22 cluster DST tests pass (20 run, 2 ignored)

- [~] **6.6: Integration tests** (Deferred)
  - Two-node TCP test deferred to Phase 7 (end-to-end integration)
  - Handler logic is tested via DST

**Deliverable:** Working request forwarding and actor migration handling
